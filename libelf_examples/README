===============

Extended Code Sampled derived from the examples outlined in 
libelf-by-example.pdf

prog1 = get-elf-test.c 

Android.mk
==========
For use with the AOSP Build System.
Directory should be placed at external/elfhack/libelf_examples

NOTES:

external/elfutils/bionic-fixup/AndroidFixup.h needs to be patched
as the declaration of dgettext is incorrect resulting in undefined 
references when attempting to compile an executable that uses libelf.a
libelf then needs to be recompiled.

From the aosp source tree ( $ANDROID_TOP ) 
patch --strip 0 < external/elfhack/libelf_examples/libelf.patch
make libelf 


Makefile
